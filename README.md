## About the author
*Note: last update to this section was in 2015, so some of the info is outdated.*

My name is [Lukáš Poláček](https://about.me/lukipuki) and I am a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden as well as part-time employee of Spotify. I'm an ACM ICPC coach at KTH and I'm also coaching some members of the Swedish IOI team. Before coming to Sweden, I was a member of the National Commitee of Slovak Olympiad in Informatics where I was also training students and organizing contests. I have organized IPSC since 2005, NCPC since 2011 (I was the head of jury from 2013 to 2015), NWERC 2010-2015 (except 2012) and [KTH Challenge](http://challenge.csc.kth.se/) since 2011.

As for my achievements, probably the most valuable one is bronze medal from ACM ICPC 2010. The second would be achieving maximum [rating 2676](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=14769155) on TopCoder.

I am not a certified ''programming coach'', neither do I have a formal education in psychology and a lot of this advice is based on personal experience and anecdotes, so I expect some of my statements to be wrong. If you think that's the case,  [send me an e-mail](mailto:lukas+wiki@polacek.email) or discuss the issue in the [TopCoder Forums](http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=783336).
